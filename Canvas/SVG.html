        HTML SVG Graphics 
        What is SVG?  
        SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics
        SVG is used to define graphics for the Web 
        The HTML <svg> element is a container for SVG graphics.
        SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML.
        SVG has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and graphic images.
        -->
        <!-- 
        SVG is XML based, which means that every element is available within the SVG DOM. You can attach JavaScript event handlers for an element.
        In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object. 
        If attributes of an SVG object are changed, the browser can automatically re-render the shape.
        Canvas is rendered pixel by pixel. In canvas, once the graphic is drawn, it is forgotten
         by the browser. If its position should be changed, 
        the entire scene needs to be redrawn, including any objects that might have been 
        covered by the graphic.

              Why should you use SVG images?
        There are a number of reasons to use SVG images, some of which are:
        SVG images do not lose their quality when zoomed or resized.
        They can be created and edited with an IDE or text editor.
        They are accessible and animatable.
        They have a small file size and are highly scalable.
        And they can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed.

            The <ellipse> element is an SVG basic shape,
                 used to create ellipses based on a center coordinate, 
                 and both their x and y radius.
            Note: Ellipses are unable to specify the exact orientation of the ellipse 
            (if, for example, you wanted to draw an ellipse tilted at a 45 degree angle), 
            but it can be rotated by using the transform attribute.

     The <polyline> SVG element is an SVG basic shape that creates straight lines

     For closed shapes see the <polygon> element. -->
