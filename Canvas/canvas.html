    <!-- HTML Canvas Graphics\
        The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics on a web page.
        Canvas draws 2D graphics, on the fly (with a JavaScript).

    <!-- Comparison of Canvas and SVG
    The table below shows some important differences between Canvas and SVG:
        Canvas
    Resolution dependent
    No support for event handlers
    Poor text rendering capabilities
    You can save the resulting image as .png or .jpg
    Well suited for graphic-intensive games 

    SVG
    Resolution independent
    Support for event handlers
    Best suited for applications with large rendering areas (Google Maps)
    Slow rendering if complex (anything that uses the DOM a lot will be slow)
    Not suited for game applications-->
