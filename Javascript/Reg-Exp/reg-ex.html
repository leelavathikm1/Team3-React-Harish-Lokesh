    <!-- A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
    Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.
    i	Perform case-insensitive matching
    g	Perform a global match (find all matches rather than stopping after the first match)
    m	Perform multiline matching

    Regular Expression Patterns
    [abc]	Find any of the characters between the brackets
    [0-9]	Find any of the digits between the brackets
    (x|y)	Find any of the alternatives separated with |

    \d	Find a digit
    \s	Find a whitespace character
    \b	Find a match at the beginning of a word like this: \bWORD, or at the end of a word like this: WORD\b
    
    Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings.
    In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects.
    These patterns are used with the exec() and test() methods of RegExp ,
    and with the match() , matchAll() , replace() , replaceAll() , search() , and split() methods of String 

    E-Mail Pattern
    const re = /^(([^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;

        <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
        //Search Method
        //Search a string for "the", and display the position of the match
        let text = " Search a string for"; 
        let reg = text.search(/a /);
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = reg;
