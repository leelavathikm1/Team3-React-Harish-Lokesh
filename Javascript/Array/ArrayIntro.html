         What is an Array?
    An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time. 
    what if you want to loop through the names and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 names, but 300?

    The solution is an array!

    An array can hold many values under a single name, 
    and you can access the values by referring to an index number.
    and the index number willstart from 0

    1.Creating an Array
        Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array.
        Syntax:
        var array_name = [name1, name2, ...];  
    
    Example
        Access the Full Array
        var  namess = ["Leela", "Lokesh", "Harish"];
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = names;
        
    JavaScript array elements are accessed using numeric indexes (starting from 0)
        var  namess = ["Leela", "Lokesh", "Harish"];
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = names[0]

    Changing an Array Element
        var  namess = ["Leela", "Lokesh", "Harish"];
        names[0]="Murali";
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = names[0]
    
    Arrays are Objects
    Arrays are a special type of objects. The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.
        But, JavaScript arrays are best described as arrays.
        Arrays use numbers to access its "elements".
        var  names = ["Leela", "Lokesh", "Harish"];
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = names[0]

    Array Elements Can Be Objects
        JavaScript variables can be objects. Arrays are special kinds of objects.
        Because of this, you can have variables of different types in the same Array.
        You can have objects in an Array. You can have functions in an Array. You can have arrays in an Array:

    Array Properties and Methods
        The real strength of JavaScript arrays are the built-in array properties and methods:
        
    The length Property
        The length property returns the length of an array
        var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruits.length;
        The length property is always one more than the highest array index.

    Accessing the First Array Element
        const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruits[0];
    
    Accessing the Last Array Element
        var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruits[fruits.length-1];

    How to Recognize an Array
         the JavaScript operator typeof returns "object":
        var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = typeof fruits;
    The typeof operator returns object because a JavaScript array is an object.

      
    When to Use Arrays. When to use Objects.
        You should use objects when you want the element names to be strings (text).
        You should use arrays when you want the element names to be numbers.
